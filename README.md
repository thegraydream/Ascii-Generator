# How to install it
First of all thank you for downloading my word converter in ascii, to install it is very simple you just have to download it, extract it, then launch the file **"install.bat"** (python is required), it will install all the modules necessary to the functioning of the bot.
Once this is done you have to click on the file **"start.bat"**.

# How to use it
How to use it? nothing simpler you just have to enter the words or sentence you want, a small loading will implement (it lasts -2 minutes), when the loading is finished you will have all the ascii available, you can navigate between the different ascii with the left and right directional arrow, if you have an ascii that suits you press space.

Once the ascii is chosen you will be able to modify it, add prints, word at the beginning, at the end and many other features.
